## Requirements for the toolkit

### General requirements
- Python 3.10 or higher.
- Labstreaminglayer - install here. 

### Metabolic cost.
- Cosmed or other metabolic cart device.
- Setup metabolic cost acquisition code.

### ECG
- Polar H10
- Bluetooth capible laptop for ECG.

### Foot pressure.
- Pressure SDK.


## Installation
Complete python HIL toolkit install
```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Testing the installtion.
This will test the all the files are setup for simple installtion. **Does not test the ECG, or metabolic cost acquisition**
```bash
pytest .
```

## Device setups
### ECG device setup
For setting up the new polar H10 ( ECG sensor )
- Please turn on the computer bluetooth connection.
- Run the following script to find all the available POLAR sensor scripts `python scripts/search_polar.py`. This script will search for polar sensors in the bluetooth range and save the BLE information in the `config/polar.yml` file. And return success or failure.
- Run the script to collect data from the polar and send it. `python scripts/collect_polar.py`


## Estimation

> **warning**
> The estimation is not fully tested. Please use with caution.

## Metabolic cost estimation.

### Estimation in scripts for offline.
- Run the following script to estimate the metabolic cost. `python scripts/estimate_metabolic_cost.py`
- This script will estimate the estimate the metabolic cost data in the provided in the `data/met_data.npy`.
- The scrip will generate the estimation and the also video as shown in the following figure.
![Metabolic cost estimation](scripts/Results/figures/metabolic_cost_estimation.png)
- It will also make a video of the estimation and the actual data. The video will be saved in the `scripts/Results/videos/` folder.

### Estimation in notebooks.
- Run the following notebook . `notebooks/preprocessing_cosmed.ipynb` to convert the raw data to the metabolic cost data.
- To perform the estimation run the following notebook. `notebooks/estimation_cosmed.ipynb`
